# Breaking into Cyber Security

## Who is this for?
The goal of this article is to give people with little or no technical knowledge a guide to breaking into the technical side of cyber security. I often come across people that are interested in joining the field whether it be folks with existing non-technical cybersec jobs, those looking to start a new career path, or people who want to just "pop shells" (more on this later). I've met quite a few folks that are interested in how they can start their cybersec journey.

As someone with a couple years under my belt, but is also fresh enough to remember my path I thought it might be a good idea to create an article on this topic. Plus now I can just send people this link when they ask!

DISCLAIMER: This is all based on my own personal experience, perceptions, and goals. That is to say I am subjective!! There are many ways to break into security this is just a reflection on what I would tell a younger version of myself knowing what did and didn't work for me.

## Pursue what interests you
If I had to say one phrase to sum it all up it would be this, "pursue what interests you".

I know, I know, easier said than done right? Security seems so broad how am I suppose to figure out where to start? While one solid path is getting a degree, lots of people either don't have the time or money to do such a thing. Plus if you already have a degree it might just be more efficient (when it comes to building your resume) to do self learning, certifications, and online courses instead.

The reason I recommend pursuing what you're interested in so much is that I find it makes the process a lot easier. If you have some personal curiosity I find it provides more motivation than "if I do this I can make more money". When you are actually interested it will feel less like you are doing a chore and more like a hobby. Now I'm not going to say its going to provide the same carefully calculated positive feedback loop as video games. God knows I've had to drag myself through learning certain things, but in general I have found interest and curiosity a better motivator than future prospects and money (probably because learning things you're interested in gives you some reward now, which creates a shorter positive feedback loop).

Now if you don't know what interests you this is where courses can help. A good online course can provide a solid high level overview giving you topics to further dive into. I believe selecting a topic no matter how vague is a key aspect of self learning (at least it has worked for me). Once you have a topic this gives you something to dive into, for me this was Linux. Linux is used almost everywhere for a lot of things and although the topic "Linux" is more systems administration than security it is still related. This is what I think is key, finding topics that are somewhat related to security and interest you. Although you should always try to keep things security related I wouldn't be too concerned about making %100 sure you are being as focused as possible. The only way to truly understand how to secure a system is to understand how that system works. So as long as your are learning about how systems work (servers, networking, email, people) you are learning about security.

## A degree is likely worth it
For what it's worth I did not like school, but if you have the capability to take a program that provides a security degree I would almost always recommend doing it.

The reasons for this are pretty simple:
1. Curated content from an institution you can likely trust (always research programs before enrolling, get other knowledgeable peoples take on the syllabus)
2. Courses will be structured to provide the required skills employers want
3. Will provide you with solid fundamentals (even if the content is a bit out of date)
4. Provides you with a reputable piece of paper (job postings usually want degrees)
5. Co-op/internship opportunities (as much as you can learn on your own employers still highly value actual work experience)
6. It's not the cheapest so hopefully it forces you to go learn

In my opinion self learning takes more motivation and grit than school, so school is actually a pretty good option. Be realistic "Do I actually have the self motivation to learn this by myself? Will school make this an easier process?"

## Courses and Fundamentals
Even though I got the majority of my education through school I have still taken a couple online courses in order to obtain certs. That being said I am no expert on online courses although I think I can give some basic advice.

First things first, I believe that generally the more entertaining content is the higher the chance that content is not very useful or won't stick (think YouTube, TikTok). That isn't to say YouTube is useless I think it's quite the opposite, but good educational YouTube content won't be nearly as entertaining as regular videos. If you are going to follow online courses generally paid content will be a bit better or at least easier to follow as someone has taken the steps to curate content. Another thing is to look for content with hands on labs. Labs will force you to actually engage with the content giving a higher chance that it will stick. Labs can also kick start your curiosity. I usually find tha once I learn one thing I will start to explore what else I can do with this new knowledge. Sometimes this just leads me to getting ahead of the syllabus, but when you tinker you are more importantly exploring the content in a more engaging way and autonomous way.

If I was to hammer home anything it would be do the labs and explore outside the syllabus using these newly learned skills. I've taken courses before with the goal of obtaining a cert and have gotten away without doing the labs. Not only was the content a drag to go through but I didn't really retain much of that information (even though I did pass the exam). This was because I actually wasn't egaging with the content more just trying to memorize it.

## Attitude and Personality
In my experience the personality trait employers (and myself) like the best is curiosity (especially if they know and understand you are new to the field). I had the fortune of being a panelist at an event hosted by my former college where soon to be grads had the opportunity to ask alumni what they should focus on to increase their job prospects. This got me thinking in a new "employer" mindset as I had never been in a situation where I was evaluating students and the qualities that make a good intern. The people I felt the most comfortable recommending were those that were passionate, curious, and understanding of their abilities/limitations.

Now I want to be careful here when I mention passion. Security and specifically tech have a big grindset mentality of doing extra curriculars (Hack the Box, LeetCode). While these things will undoubtedly help you in your quest for more knowledge and are a good way to demonstrate passion you do not need to be doing these 24/7. I've seen many students online brag about how they are on the "grindset" popping 20 boxes a day. Not only is posturing in this way a "bad look", but most people also understand that people need a life outside of work. If they don't you probably don't want to work for them (or if you just need a job you probably won't want to work for them for long).

Continuing on the topic of people that brag, you will find a fair few of them in security. Being someone that has confidence but quickly acknowledges what you don't know will take you much further than pretending. This field is massive and you are not expected to know everything. Everyone has the things they are good and not so, the people that are good at things probably have spent a lot of time doing so and will usually be able to tell when someone is posturing (there is nothing worse than pretending to know something and having someone call you out on it). Be curious, admit what you don't know, show that you try to learn, and ask questions (there are "dumb" questions, but anyone worth their salt doesn't care when you ask them, they only care when you ask them the same question again for the 10th time because you didn't listen).

## Red vs Blue
### Red (sexy)
A lot of new folks are either first introduced to security by the red side, or want to pursue it because "they want to be a hacker". I was one of these people, as much as I hate to admit it I liked the perceived clout of the "hacker" moniker. And you know what, if that title pushes you to learn about security then I'd say go for it. Just know there are other less sexy options that still pay the bills.

Things to note about pentesting. First the red side is more competitive and as a result will require more of your time. The red side can be more technically interesting and as a result attracts "passionate individuals" (people that are willing to work after hours, sometimes for free). Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, if you really enjoy what you do putting that extra time in is easy. For me personally this doesn't work, I very much value my own time to do other things (even if I do just end up working on more tech stuff). Before "picking a side" a would make sure you understand where your limits are and how much time you are willing to invest into your career.

#### "Popping shells"
Many people want to become pentesters so that they can just "pop shells". Although pentesters do pop shells your work is going to be much more than that. Scoping calls, working weird hours, emailing clients, and reports are all part of the job so be prepared for the not so sexy stuff as well. If the shell popping is truly worth all the extras when it comes to pentesting, then congrats you're on the right path! If you are looking for a job that requires a bit less investment but still has emails (we all love emails) you can always go blue.

### Blue
Typically not what people think about when you tell them you work in cyber security, but still another great side of the career thats often overlooked by newbies. If you like setting up infrastructure, networking, and working with the cloud then this might be the route for you. Like I said earlier when I first got out of school I was dead set on getting a job as a pentester. That didn't work out due to the hiring freezes in 2020 (covid) and eventually I ended up working for a smaller company as a security engineer. This is where I learned that I actually really liked working with infrastructure. This shouldn't have been a surprise to me since I was always the one setting up the infrastructure for group labs in school, but it did as I was blinded by the clout of being a "pentester". My point here is while a lot (and when I say a lot I mean a lot, go ask any prof) of people want to be pentesters there is a whole other side of this field that people end up disregarding. Figure out what you actually like regardless of how "cool" it is and go for it.

## Imposter syndrome
Before I end off I wanted to add a couple notes on imposter syndrome. As much as I'm not a fan of the term I understand why it exist and have definitely felt the affects of it. Here are some things I wish I knew that would have given me more confidence.

The first is no one knows everything. You will meet people that will have vast in depth knowledge on certain areas of security and tech. You might be intimidated by these people but know that this knowledge wasn't gained overnight. It took them time to learn all these things which means you won't learn everything overnight and you are not expected to either. You shouldn't feel bad for not knowing everything on the spot. Security and tech in general are large fields where some people will know a lot about one area and none about another. You probably have your own topics that you are more knowledgable in that aren't security related. Any decent person in this field will be more than happy to answer your questions, after all it usually makes us feel smart when we can share some of the useful stuff we've learned over the years (why do you think I'm making this article). My best advice would be when you identify someone that is knowledgeable don't be afraid to ask them questions (I'm saying this as someone that use to be). Even if they do judge you for not knowing it's usually better to ask "dumb" questions early on rather than asking them after being 6 months on the job.

Another tip I have learned is there are people who will talk confidently about things they don't truly understand. Some people like to posture that they know things so they can appear smart (key word is appear). I use to take these people at face value and was intimidated by them. Now that isn't to say there aren't confident people that do know their shit, just that there are also confident people that don't. One of the tell tail signs I have found is gatekeeping. Not only is anyone gatekeeping not worth your time, but I have found a fair few occasions where the people that gatekept weren't actually correct. My tip for working with these people is to be careful with challegnitg them. If they are more senior than you it is often a better play to just act like they are correct and give them the good old "that's interesting I didn't know that!". Then you can go look it up afterwords and bask in the glory of being right on your own time.

As long as you admit when you don't know things and ask people that have experience questions, most people will like you.
